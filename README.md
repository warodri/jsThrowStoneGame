# jsThrowStoneGame

I wanted to create from scatch (without any game engine) what is to be to throw a ball with Javascritp.

Not only throwing a ball, but also define the speed and altitude I want. Also apply a force from the other side and calculate all that.

Well, I accomplish all that in only 38 lines of code (I used the p5.js library) to simplify drawing stuff but nothing else. 
I'm not using any other function from that great library.
