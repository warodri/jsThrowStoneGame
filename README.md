# jsThrowStoneGame

I wanted to create from scatch (without any game engine) a program for throwing a ball with Javascritp.

Not only throwing a ball, but also define any speed and altitude. 
Also I wanted to apply a force from the other side (for example: wind) and calculate all that.

Well, I accomplish all that in only 38 lines of code :-)

You'll see on this screen recording some frames missing but that's because the software I used to convert to GIF.
Download these 2 files and try it yourself. Use this as you please.

I used one library (the p5.js library) just to simplify drawing stuff on screen but nothing else. 
I'm not using any other function from the P5 library.
